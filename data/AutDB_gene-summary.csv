Rare ASD-associated variants in the SCN2A gene were initially identified in a study by Weiss and colleagues in 2003 based on exon screening in a region of linkage with autism (PMID 12610651).

Two de novo loss-of-function variants and two de novo missense variants in TBR1 have been identified in simplex ASD cases (PMIDs 22495309, 23160955, 22495311); these variants were not observed in controls or in external databases. Functional analysis in Deriziotis et al., 2014 demonstrated that these four de novo TBR1 variants disrupt multiple aspects of TBR1 function, including interactions with co-regulators such as CASK and/or FOXP2, cellular localization, and transcriptional regulation (PMID 25232744). Analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 ASD cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or paternal controls from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) in De Rubeis et al., 2014 identified TBR1 as a gene meeting high statistical significance with a FDR  0.01, meaning that this gene had a  99% chance of being a true autism gene (PMID 25363760). This gene was identified in Iossifov et al. 2015 as a strong candidate to be an ASD risk gene based on a combination of de novo mutational evidence and the absence or very low frequency of mutations in controls (PMID 26401017). Microdeletions encompassing TBR1 have also been identified in patients with developmental delay/intellectual disability (PMIDs 23112752, 24458984).  den Hoed et al., 2018 functionally characterized two previously identified de novo TBR1 missense variants seen in ASD probands (p.Trp271Cys from De Rubeis et al., 2014 and p.Lys389Glu from ORoak et al., 2014) and determined that both variants disrupted multiple aspects of TBR1 function, including cellular localization and interactions with CASK, FOXP1, and FOXP2; the authors of this study also determined that the rare inherited TBR1 missense variant p.Gln418Arg (originally reported in an ASD proband in Deriziotis et al., 2014) disrupted the interaction between TBR1 and BCL11A.  Through international data sharing, Nambot et al., 2020 collected data from 25 previously unreported individuals with TBR1 variants and found that autistic features were frequently observed (19/25 individuals), with five individuals receiving a diagnosis of ASD according to DSM-IV and/or ADOS criteria.",30,1,28158988,0,,22495309,,"24441682,25309323,25363760,25600067,26401017,27325115,30250039,30318412,31680851,32005960","10749215,22495311,23112752,23160955,24458984,25232744,25356899,25418537,26402605,27479843,28234597,28554332,28628100,29288087,30268909,31231135,31981491,32277047"
